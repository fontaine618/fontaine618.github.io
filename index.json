Specifically, current BCI technology often rely on analysing event-related potentials (ERP), such as the P300 signal, as measurable electroencephalography (EEG) responses to stimuli presented to the user. However, crucial information is often overlooked by focusing solely on well-characterized ERPs. In particular, studying the whole EEG measurements following the onset of a stimulus throughout the scalp can improve the performance of BCIs as well as our understanding of the brain functions responsible for information processing and decision-making. We propose a novel Bayesian model based on dynamic latent factor models, which provide two crucial improvements over existing methods. First, we learn latent factors across EEG electrodes and time which allows dimensionality reduction, abstraction of the BCI design and decomposition of complex electrode-wise responses into interpretable sub-components.  Second, we allow spatial correlation across electrodes to vary both with time and stimulus type (target or nontarget), which captures changes in functional connectivity following the onset of a stimulus, along with variations associated with intent. The application of our model to real BCI sessions provide valuable insight by recovering and refining some of the known ERPs, discovering new signals and highlighting variations in functional connectivity that were mostly unexplored so far.","tags":null,"title":"Dynamic Latent Factor Regression for EEG-Based Brain-Computer Interfaces","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Simon Fontaine"],"categories":["Misc"],"content":"","date":1717200000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1719856906,"objectID":"1cc12070e72677ec3a64f7d916f13b6c","permalink":"https://fontaine618.github.com/publication/fontaine-statistical-2024/","publishdate":"2024-07-01T14:01:46-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/fontaine-statistical-2024/","section":"publication","summary":"Dependency among observations can arise from a multitude of sources, including spatial or temporal correlation, grouped, clustered or repeated measurements, hierarchical structures, and dyadic interactions. Neglecting these interdependencies in statistical analyses may result in incorrect inferences or loss of statistical power. Conversely, adequately modeling these dependencies not only enhances the validity of our statistical inferences but also deepens our comprehension of the intricate dynamics that generate the data. In this dissertation, we propose innovative methodologies tailored to three cases, each exemplifying unique challenges of dependent data. First, we consider an imputation task where dependency among subjects is captured by a network structure. Be leveraging both between-variable and between-subjects dependencies in a joint latent space model, we obtain more accurate predictions for the missing data. Second, we study a differential analysis task within the context of longitudinal data, driven by a study on microbial abundance data. To accommodate the temporal dependencies and the continuous nature of the biological data, we opt for a varying-coefficient mixed model estimated through penalized kernel smoothing, producing locally sparse varying-coefficients. Crucially, accounting for time dependence is shown to improve estimation accuracy as well as support recovery. Third, we explore a modeling task emerging from a brain-computer interface setting. Specifically, we aim to construct a model of the brain's electrical activity, in relation to its response to visual stimuli presented under an oddball paradigm, in which only certain stimuli are pertinent. By adopting a dynamic latent factor approach, we obtain an interpretable decomposition across electrodes and time. Further, we capture temporal variation in the spatial covariance, providing additional insight into the functional connectivity.","tags":[],"title":"Statistical Models for Dependent Data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mukai Wang","Simon Fontaine","Hui Jiang","Gen Li"],"categories":["Microbiome"],"content":"","date":1715904000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1715904000,"objectID":"aca4e8b4747cd2d6f0f36ac0f91e85a3","permalink":"https://fontaine618.github.com/publication/wang-adapt-2024/","publishdate":"2024-05-17T16:48:04.768455Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wang-adapt-2024/","section":"publication","summary":"Microbiome differential abundance analysis remains a challenging problem despite multiple methods proposed in the literature. The excessive zeros and compositionality of metagenomics data are two main challenges for differential abundance analysis.

ADAPT uniquely treats zero counts as left-censored observations to facilitate computation and enhance interpretation. ADAPT also encompasses a theoretically justified way of selecting non-differentially abundant microbiome taxa as a reference for hypothesis testing. We generate synthetic data using independent simulation frameworks to show that ADAPT has more consistent false discovery rate control and higher statistical power than competitors. We use ADAPT to analyze 16S rRNA sequencing of saliva samples and shotgun metagenomics sequencing of plaque samples collected from infants in the COHRA2 study.

This research is inspired by the premise that leveraging all available information should yield improved imputation, provided sufficient association between attributes and edges.Consequently, we introduce a joint latent space model that produces a low-dimensional representation of the data and simultaneously captures the edge and node attribute information. This model relies on the pooling of information induced by shared latent variables, thereby enhancing the prediction of node attributes and providing a more effective attribute imputation method. Our approach uses variational inference to approximate posterior distributions for these latent variables, resulting in predictive distributions for missing values.

We propose POLDA (Pooling Overdispersed Logistic Regressions for Microbiome Differential Abundance Analysis) to address the challenge. POLDA first uses overdispersed logistic regressions to model the read counts for each pair of taxa and estimate the log odds ratio  between conditions. Then, it exploits a weighted linear regression with backward selection method to identify a reference set of non-differentially-abundant taxa. Finally, overdispersed logistic regressions are used to call differentially abundant taxa based on ratios with the reference set.

Based on the model proposed by [1], our model assumes multi-dimensional latent skills decomposed into offensive and defensive components as well as team- and conference-specific skills interacting with each other through an inner product model. We propose two inference approaches: maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) and mean-field variational inference (VI). Applied to the 2004- 2017 NCAA Men’s Basketball season’s, the MLE approach yields adequate and interpretable results, but the VI approach was not as successful. Based on the MLE inference, we study the relationship between teams and conferences, we investigate league-wide trends over time and we produce rankings of teams and conferences.","tags":[],"title":"Latent Variable Modeling of Paired Comparisons with Application to NCAA Men’s Basketball Score","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Simon Fontaine","Trong Dat Do"],"categories":["Course work"],"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1634832395,"objectID":"360de51c8c87ba3c3a215e092abfaddb","permalink":"https://fontaine618.github.com/publication/fontaine-movielens-2020/","publishdate":"2021-10-21T16:06:35.531219Z","relpermalink":"/publication/fontaine-movielens-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"The MovieLens datasets contain user ratings of movies as well as movie and user information. In this report, we consider four predictive models of the ratings based on the available information: K-nearest-neighbors, neural networks, matrix completion using singular value decomposition and restricted Bolztmann machine. We tune all models to finally compare them on their out-of-sample performance: matrix completion produces the best testing metrics. Then, we propose two exploratory analysis methods in order to extract insight from the selected predictive model.","tags":[],"title":"MovieLens Datasets—Predicting and Analyzing User Ratings of Movies","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nicolas Grenon-Godbout","Jonathan Dumas","Simon Fontaine","Gabrielle Rit","Timothy Park"],"categories":["Misc"],"content":"","date":1564662600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1564662600,"objectID":"1bfeb22e2d143e94362597b2a03ef22a","permalink":"https://fontaine618.github.com/talk/online-skill-rating-algorithms/","publishdate":"2021-10-21T14:20:58-04:00","relpermalink":"/talk/online-skill-rating-algorithms/","section":"event","summary":"Skill rating algorithms are now ubiquitous in online competitive video games and are used not only to accurately compare players' strength, but also to match players of similar proficiency against each other, thus ensuring fair and exciting matches. Solidly anchored in online approximate Bayesian inference, these modern algorithms only require a prior rating for each match participant and the outcome of the match to infer posterior ratings for each player. Efforts have been made in the last decade to incorporate auxiliary information in rating computations (such as players' score in a match or their proficiency in different game modes) in order to get more accurate rating updates as well as generally faster convergence to the true underlying skills. However, as ratings also influence the matchmaking and therefore the new ratings, their distribution over all players is a highly dynamic system, where the interdependence of ratings and matchmaking impedes our ability to fully understand the impacts of potential improvements on live applications. We shall survey existing rating systems and explore the assessment challenges involved in enhancing and extending these algorithms.","tags":[],"title":"Online Skill Rating Algorithms","type":"event"},{"authors":["Simon Fontaine"],"categories":["Misc"],"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1634839306,"objectID":"e458d7e3f23566847d899e7f441aa403","permalink":"https://fontaine618.github.com/publication/fontaine-mcmc-2019/","publishdate":"2021-10-21T18:01:46.913232Z","relpermalink":"/publication/fontaine-mcmc-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"This memoir aims at introducing adaptation within the Multiple-Try Metropolis (MTM) algorithms which are a special case of the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. The MCMC methods, along with their adaptive and multiple-try extensions, are thoroughly explored (both in their possible variations and in their theoretical properties) in order to firmly anchor the study of the proposed adaptive Multiple-Try Metropolis (aMTM) algorithm. Moreover, some existing results on the properties of MTM algorithms are generalized to enable more general results about the aMTM algorithm. The ergodicity of the algorithm is then established using well known results of Roberts and Rosenthal (2007), Andrieu and Moulines (2006) and Craiu et al. (2015) and its empirical performance is studied through a series of simulation experiments. The aMTM algorithm achieves notably better performance than simpler samplers (non-adaptive or single-try) when applied to distributions that are multimodal or that exhibit complex geometry. Finally, many variations of the algorithm are proposed and compared to identify settings that are particularly more efficient. An implementation of the algorithm is provided in a R package called aMTM available at https://github.com/fontaine618/aMTM.","tags":[],"title":"MCMC adaptatifs à essais multiples","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f26b5133c34eec1aa0a09390a36c2ade","permalink":"https://fontaine618.github.com/admin/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/admin/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"page"},{"authors":["simfont"],"categories":null,"content":"Implementation of Fontaine and Bédard, 2021+.
