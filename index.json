While missing value imputation has been widely studied in the context of standard data matrices, the network with node attributes case remains fairly unexplored. In particular, using all available information, observed node attributes and edges, should improve on using only the observed attributes, provided some association between attributes and edges. We propose a novel imputation method based on a joint latent space model that allows information between the network adjacency matrix and node attributes to be shared. Additionally, we propose an extension to non-ignorable missing values by directly modeling the missingness process. Using variational inference, we obtain approximate posteriors for the latent variables enabling predictive distributions for the missing values and further allowing assessment of missingness patterns. Numerical experiments, on both simulated and real-world networks, show that our proposed method improves on multiple imputation using only the nodes attributes.","tags":[],"title":"Missing Value Imputation of Network Node Attributes","type":"event"},{"authors":["Simon Fontaine","Mylène Bédard"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1634834917,"objectID":"6c83cf91fe8ebaff8c824a5fe399ea93","permalink":"https://fontaine618.github.io/publication/fontaine-adaptive-2021/","publishdate":"2021-10-21T16:48:37.632309Z","relpermalink":"/publication/fontaine-adaptive-2021/","section":"publication","summary":"Markov  chain  Monte  Carlo  (MCMC)  methods,  specifically  samplers  based  on  random  walks,often have difficulty handling target distributions with complex geometry such as multi-modality.We propose an adaptive multiple-try Metropolis algorithm designed to tackle such problems bycombining the flexibility of multiple-proposal samplers with the user-friendliness and optimalityof  adaptive  algorithms.

Despite the wide use and simple nature of single-target approaches, modeling these types of data may benefit from an approach performing variable selection jointly across the sources. We propose a unified algorithm to perform sparse learning of such fused insurance data under the Tweedie (compound Poisson) model. By integrating ideas from multitask sparse learning and sparse Tweedie modeling, our algorithm produces flexible regularization that balances predictor sparsity and between-sources sparsity. When applied to simulated and real data, our approach clearly outperforms single-target modeling in both prediction and selection accuracy, notably when the sources do not have exactly the same set of predictors. An efficient implementation of the proposed algorithm is provided in our R package MStweedie, which is available at https://github.com/fontaine618/MStweedie.

With this project, we will assess the ability of umpires to make ball and strike calls that match the rulebook and that are consistent across different game situations. Using nonlinear classification methods such as kernel linear regression and support vector machines we can learn a strike zone for each umpire based on pitch location as well as game circumstances. After learning strike zone classifiers for each game situation and umpire combination, we use kernel PCA to create a low dimensional encoding of the strike zones that can be used for inference. We perform multiple analysis of variance and mixed effects multivariate regression on the principal components to determine which factors have a statistically significant effect on an umpire’s strike zone. Finally we compute a ranking of each umpire and compare our top umpires with those featured on other lists.","tags":[],"title":"Caught Looking: Analyzing Variation in Umpire Strike Zones","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Simon Fontaine"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1634832395,"objectID":"a0ba42dcf699e69966fe37d5b26b5737","permalink":"https://fontaine618.github.io/publication/fontaine-latent-2020/","publishdate":"2021-10-21T16:06:35.716646Z","relpermalink":"/publication/fontaine-latent-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"We propose a latent variable model for paired comparisons in the context of Basketball scores.

Solidly anchored in online approximate Bayesian inference, these modern algorithms only require a prior rating for each match participant and the outcome of the match to infer posterior ratings for each player. Efforts have been made in the last decade to incorporate auxiliary information in rating computations (such as players' score in a match or their proficiency in different game modes) in order to get more accurate rating updates as well as generally faster convergence to the true underlying skills. However, as ratings also influence the matchmaking and therefore the new ratings, their distribution over all players is a highly dynamic system, where the interdependence of ratings and matchmaking impedes our ability to fully understand the impacts of potential improvements on live applications. We shall survey existing rating systems and explore the assessment challenges involved in enhancing and extending these algorithms.","tags":[],"title":"Online Skill Rating Algorithms","type":"event"},{"authors":["Simon Fontaine"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1634839306,"objectID":"e458d7e3f23566847d899e7f441aa403","permalink":"https://fontaine618.github.io/publication/fontaine-mcmc-2019/","publishdate":"2021-10-21T18:01:46.913232Z","relpermalink":"/publication/fontaine-mcmc-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"This memoir aims at introducing adaptation within the Multiple-Try Metropolis (MTM) algorithms which are a special case of the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. The MCMC methods, along with their adaptive and multiple-try extensions, are thoroughly explored (both in their possible variations and in their theoretical properties) in order to firmly anchor the study of the proposed adaptive Multiple-Try Metropolis (aMTM) algorithm. Moreover, some existing results on the properties of MTM algorithms are generalized to enable more general results about the aMTM algorithm. The ergodicity of the algorithm is then established using well known results of Roberts and Rosenthal (2007), Andrieu and Moulines (2006) and Craiu et al. (2015) and its empirical performance is studied through a series of simulation experiments. The aMTM algorithm achieves notably better performance than simpler samplers (non-adaptive or single-try) when applied to distributions that are multimodal or that exhibit complex geometry. Finally, many variations of the algorithm are proposed and compared to identify settings that are particularly more efficient.
