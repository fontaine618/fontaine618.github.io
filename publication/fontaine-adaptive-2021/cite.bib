 abstract = {Markov  chain  Monte  Carlo  (MCMC)  methods,  specifically  samplers  based  on  random  walks,often have difficulty handling target distributions with complex geometry such as multi-modality.We propose an adaptive multiple-try Metropolis algorithm designed to tackle such problems bycombining the flexibility of multiple-proposal samplers with the user-friendliness and optimalityof  adaptive  algorithms.  We  prove  the  ergodicity  of  the  resulting  Markov  chain  with  respectto  the  target  distribution  using  common  techniques  in  the  adaptive  MCMC  literature.  In  aBayesian model for loss of heterozygosity in cancer cells, we find that our method outperformstraditional adaptive samplers, non-adaptive multiple-try Metropolis samplers, and various moresophisticated competing methods.},
