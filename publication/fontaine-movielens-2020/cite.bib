 abstract = {The MovieLens datasets contain user ratings of movies as well as movie and user
information. In this report, we consider four predictive models of the ratings based on the
available information: K-nearest-neighbors, neural networks, matrix completion using singular
value decomposition and restricted Bolztmann machine. We tune all models to finally compare
them on their out-of-sample performance: matrix completion produces the best testing metrics.
Then, we propose two exploratory analysis methods in order to extract insight from the selected
predictive model.},
